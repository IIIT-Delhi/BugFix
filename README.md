# BugFix

BugFix is a collaborative coding repository dedicated to practicing bug identification and fixing. The repository contains intentionally introduced bugs in Python code snippets, providing a space for members to enhance their debugging skills.

## How It Works

1. **Main Branch (Buggy Code):**
   - Contains Python code snippets with intentional bugs.
   - Members fork this repository and create branches from the `main` branch for bug fixing.

2. **Solution Branch (Fixed Code):**
   - Provides corrected versions of the code in the `main` branch.
   - Members can compare their fixes with the solutions in this branch.

3. **Contributing:**
   - Members fork the repository and create a branch for bug fixing.
   - After fixing a bug, members submit pull requests for review.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a branch from the `main` branch for bug fixing.
4. Fix the bugs and submit a pull request.

## Code Structure

- `main.py`: Contains Python code snippets with intentional bugs.
- `solution.py`: Provides corrected versions of the code for reference.

## Bugs to Fix

The `main.py` file includes intentional bugs in Python code snippets. Practice identifying and fixing these bugs to enhance your debugging skills.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b 'bug-fix-branch'
    ```

3. Fix the bugs in the code.
4. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Fixed bug in function_name"
    ```

5. Push to the branch:

    ```bash
    git push origin bug-fix-branch
    ```

6. Submit a pull request.
